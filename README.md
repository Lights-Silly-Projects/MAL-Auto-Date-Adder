# MAL Watch Dates

A utility tool that tries to add your Start/End watching dates to your MAL.

This was written more so as a way for me to learn how to use selenium
(and doing web stuff in a programmetic fashion in general).
The code is no doubt pretty atrocious under actual scrutiny, but hey!
It's functional (mostly)!

## Requirements

-   Python 3.10+
-   MAL account

## How to use

1. Rename the `.env.template` file to `.env`
2. Fill in the information (must be plain-text. Do not share this file with your password in it!)
3. Run `python -m mal_dates` in this directory
4. Paws off the keyboard and mouse, mister!
5. Get a drink, this will take a while.

Most of the code is easily(?) accessible
(though no doubt more could be abstracted into their own functions).
Consult `__main__.py` for an example on basic usage.
